# Balancing-Robot
This is a personal project where I am designing, building, and programming a robot that can balance on two wheels. Some goals I have for this robot are:
1. Simple Balance - if the robot is pushed, correct the disturbance and regain balance
2. Position Lock - once the robot regains its balance, return to the original location
3. Joystick Control - be able to control the robot's movement using a joystick via a phone app

I learned about stepper motors and stepper motor control, Complementary Filters, and complex PID control during this project.
